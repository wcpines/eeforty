## WIP

Learning project to play with Elixir/Erlang OTP fundamentals like Genservers and ETS.

Project has been largely abandoned in part because of changes to the Google Maps API but I have aspirations to revisit.

Given a starting point, destination, travel-time threshold, and departure time threshold, get a text alert for when you're cleared for departure.
